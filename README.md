# OpenWindowAlarm
Place this on a windowsill and you will be alarmed if you opened the window too long, which means more than 5 minutes.
It senses the falling temperature, so it works best in winter.

OpenWindowAlarm on a windowsill

# Function
Every 24 seconds a sample is taken of the ATtiny internal temperature sensor which has a resolution of 1 degree.
If temperature is lower than "old" temperature value, then an alarm is issued 5 minutes later, if "the condition still holds".
Detection of an open window is indicated by a longer 20ms blink and a short click every 24 seconds.
A low battery (below 3.55 Volt) is indicated by beeping and flashing LED every 24 seconds. Only the beep (not the flash) is significantly longer than at open window detection.


# How to make your own
![Parts](https://github.com/ArminJo/Arduino-OpenWindowAlarm/blob/master/pictures/Parts.jpg)
The parts you need

## Installation of tools
Install the Digispark board for the Arduino IDE as described in http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting
Since we want to save power, the board clock is switched to 1MHz in our setup() so please choose **Digispark (1mhz - No USB)** 
as board in the *Tools* menu in order to get the right timing.

## Programming the Digispark board
Create a new sketch with *File/New* and name it e.g. OpenWindowAlarm
Copy the code from [OpenWindowAlarm.ino](https://github.com/ArminJo/Arduino-OpenWindowAlarm/blob/master/OpenWindowAlarm.ino)
Compile and upload it. Keep in mind, that upload can not work if speaker is connected.
If everything was right, the build in LED of the Digispark will blink 5 times and then do a first flash after 8 seconds and afterwards flashes at a 24 seconds interval.

## Power reduction
![Final power reduction](https://github.com/ArminJo/Arduino-OpenWindowAlarm/blob/master/pictures/Digispark.jpg)
Before power reduction changes

Now we have a module which uses 6 mA. It is possible to reduce power consumption to 6 ÂµA in 3 Steps.
1. Disabling the power LED by removing / disabling the 102 resistor or the LED saves 2 mA.
2. Removing the VIN Voltage regulator saves 1.5 mA.
3. Disconnecting the USB Pullup 152 resistor from 5 Volt (VCC) saves 2mA, but disables the USB interface and in turn the bootloader too.

   But there is a solution: 
   If you use a battery like on the picture below then just connect the resistor directly to the USB 5 Volt which is easily available at one side of the diode. 
   The right side can be found by using a continuity tester. One side of this diode is connected to pin 8 of the ATtiny (VCC).
   The other side is connected to USB 5V.
   
   If you plan to connect the WindowAlarm board to an USB power bank, you must disconnect the resistor after programming the device, otherwise it will need 10mA from the battery just for the resistor :-(.
   
   Or flush first a new bootloader with [Burn_upgrade_micronucleus-t85_pullup_at_0.cmd](https://github.com/ArminJo/Arduino-OpenWindowAlarm/blob/master/Burn_upgrade_micronucleus-t85_pullup_at_0.cmd) and then connect the resistor to P0 (Pin4).

# Placement
To use the board place it on a windowsill and connect it with a battery or USB power bank.
If the temperature on the sill is lower than the temperature, the board was located from,
it takes additional 5 Minutes to intelligently adopt to the new reference value.

# Internal Operation
* Open window is detected after (TEMPERATURE_COMPARE_AMOUNT * TEMPERATURE_SAMPLE_SECONDS) seconds of reading a temperature which value is TEMPERATURE_DELTA_THRESHOLD_DEGREE lower than the temperature (TEMPERATURE_COMPARE_DISTANCE * TEMPERATURE_SAMPLE_SECONDS) seconds before.
* The delay is implemented by 3 times sleeping at `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN` for a period of 8 seconds in order to reduce power consumption.
* Detection of an open window is indicated by a longer 20ms blink and a short click every 24 seconds.
   The internal sensor has therefore 3 minutes time to adjust to the outer temperature, to get even small changes in temperature.
   The greater the temperature change the earlier the change of sensor value and detection of an open window.
* After open window detection Alarm is activated after OPEN_WINDOW_MINUTES if actual temperature is not higher than the minimum temperature (+ 1) i.e. the window is not closed yet.
* Every hour the battery voltage is measured. A low battery (below 3.55 Volt) is indicated by beeping and flashing LED every 24 seconds. Only the beep (not the flash) is significantly longer than at open window detection.
